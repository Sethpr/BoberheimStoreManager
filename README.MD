This is a basic program that I am using to manage some stores in a dnd game I'm running. I realize what I'm doing here is basically a worse version of a database but I wanted to program in python so this seemed more fun than spooling up a database. 

If any of my players are seeing this: Don't look at the txt files. They are not for your eyes.
